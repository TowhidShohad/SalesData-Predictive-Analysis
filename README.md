# SalesData-Predictive-Analysis
📊 Sales Data Predictive Analysis
This project involves an in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling task based on a historical retail sales dataset. It aims to uncover business insights through data visualization and forecast sales using machine learning models.

🔍 Project Objective
To analyze patterns in historical sales data, identify key sales drivers, and build predictive models (Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor) to forecast future sales values. The project also includes a comprehensive visual analytics component for enhanced business insight.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a cleaned version of the sales_data_sample.csv, containing fields such as:

ORDERDATE

QUANTITYORDERED

PRICEEACH

PRODUCTLINE

SALES

COUNTRY

DEALSIZE

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

MS Word (for reporting)

📈 Models Applied
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Both models were evaluated using:
